Technical Leader, Globant (www.globant.com)

Working as a contractor for Active Broadband Networks. In charge of leading a team of people developing a system for collecting large volumes of data from cablemodem devices in order to gather usage statistics for a whole network.
The current implementation is deployed in the Comcast network, handling around 17 million cablemodem devices. Due to the sheer amount of data involved, several ad-hoc solutions had to be developed in order to manage this data while still complying to performance and hardware requirements, and being able to provide rich dataset for performing deeper analysis on the stored data.

Senior Software Engineer, Global (www.globant.com)

Worked as a contractor for Yahoo!. Designed and developed the UI for an internal application for the Sponsored Search Management System.

Worked as a contractor for Google. Designed and developed the UI for a VoIP application intended to serve as a high-performance and scalable PBX.
The initial requirement was for the application to handle up to 10K simultaneous SIP connections with a foreseen demand for up to 100K.
The system would be used worldwide across several locations, in a distributed fashion.

Designed and developed a four-language multilingual web portal on top of the Plone CMS, with a completely redesigned interface; the multilingual system was novel in that it would present content to the user in several languages simultaneously, according to each user's personal perferences.
Also designed and implemented a news gathering system that would screen-scrape several news sites and then integrate the gathered content into the portal, so that it could be searched like any other user generated content.

Also dealt with monitoring and ensuring availibility of all these services. Some achievements include setting up an anti-spam mail filtering system that filtered 40000 spam emails daily, and setting up a single sign on infrastructure using OpenLDAP and Kerberos for simplifying granting access to the different servers to faculty members.
