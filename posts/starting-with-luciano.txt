Luciano is the latest addition to my collection of ongoing proyects.
The idea behind it is to have a tutor for enhancing your singing
skills.

My goal with luciano is to make it capture input from a microphone,
analyze the voice audio, and map it to midi-like notes, so that it can
display the notes you are singing.
In addition to this, luciano will follow a score (for example a midi
file), and match the notes recognized in the raw audio input to the
notes that should have been sung.

In that way, the singer will have a visual feedback to the way he/she
is singing. For example, he/she may see if the note he/she just sang
was correct or if it was out of pitch.

The general idea is that by having the computer mark the errors, it
will make it easier for the singer to learn a particular score.
