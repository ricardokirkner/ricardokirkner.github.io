Clearly, the aubionotes default pitch detector is quite sensitive when
analyzing vocal audio. It throws in a lot of in-between notes, which makes
the resulting midi output a bit "tremolous".

I think now is the time to read more about the different pitch detection
functions, and/or other filters to try to make the pitch detection algorithm
less sensitive to small pitch variations, or else maybe even implementing my
own pitch detection algorithm.

So far it has been a lot of fun!
